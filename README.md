# MVC Website
 The project revolved around the creation of an easily scalable website (with any changes to the MySQL database being accurately reflected on the site), including dynamic functionality in a resizable form factor. A Model, View, Controller approach was taken to achieve these requirements and create an overall more secure website. (visual enhancements via CSS was not required)

Note: The MySQL database information has been removed.
